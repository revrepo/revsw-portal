Feature: Work with WAF functionality
  As a user with role (revAdmi,admin, user)
  I can make configuration WAF for domain

  Scenario: Open configuration settings
   Given I open portal "https://127.0.0.1:3000"
    When I login as user with role "[revAdmin|user]"
    When I create new domain configuration with name "demo.com"
    When I open created domain
    When I select tab with name "WAF"
    Then I should see text "Coming Soon!!!"
