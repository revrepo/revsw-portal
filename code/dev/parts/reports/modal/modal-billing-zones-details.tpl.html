  <p>This table details the allocation of our edge locations per traffic billing zone. Please note that when assigning end user traffic to a billing zone we look at which our edge
    site served the end user and not what is the actual location of the user. For example, if for a reason a user in Brazil was served from one of our US locations the traffic is marked as in
    "North America" billing zone and not as in "South America" zone.</p>
